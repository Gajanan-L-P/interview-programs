/*
Sorted insert for circular linked list:-
Algorithm:-
Allocate memory for the newly inserted node and put data in the newly allocated node. 
Let the pointer to the new node be new_node. After memory allocation, following are the three cases that need to be handled.

1) Linked List is empty:  
    a)  since new_node is the only node in CLL, make a self loop.      
          new_node->next = new_node;  
    b) change the head pointer to point to new node.
          *head_ref = new_node;
2) New node is to be inserted just before the head node:    
  (a) Find out the last node using a loop.
         while(current->next != *head_ref)
            current = current->next;
  (b) Change the next of last node. 
         current->next = new_node;
  (c) Change next of new node to point to head.
         new_node->next = *head_ref;
  (d) change the head pointer to point to new node.
         *head_ref = new_node;
3) New node is to be  inserted somewhere after the head: 
   (a) Locate the node after which new node is to be inserted.
         while ( current->next!= *head_ref && 
             current->next->data < new_node->data)
         {   current = current->next;   }
   (b) Make next of new_node as next of the located pointer
         new_node->next = current->next;
   (c) Change the next of the located pointer
         current->next = new_node;

Case 2 of the above algorithm/code can be optimized.
