Low Level Design(LLD) and High Level Design (HLD) in the Design phase of SDLC:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High Level design gives overall view of the system while in LLD gives detailed view.

High Level Design(HLD): It design the over all architecture of the entire system from main module to all sub module.
Low Level Design(LLD) : It defines Internal logic of corresponding submodule designers are preparing individual LLD to Every module.

High Level Design(HLD): is the first output in your system design phase(in SDLC).Here we design the overall architecture of the system.
The main functional or all the core modules are given shape here.This also include contr0l flow b/w main modules,e-r status etc.
	Main output's are E-r diagram,flow chart,DFD's etc

Low Level Design(LLD) : we create more detail and specific design of the system.how exactly we make the dB structure,interface design etc
	Main output's are DB's schema,frameworks,Interface desins etc.
	
Level Design or System Design (HLD):
------------------------------------
High level Design gives the overall System Design in terms of Functional Architecture and Database design. This is very useful for the developers to 
understand the flow of the system. In this phase design team, review team (testers) and customers plays a major role. For this the entry criteria are the 
requirement document that is SRS. And the exit criteria will be HLD, projects standards, the functional design documents, and the database design document.

Low Level Design (LLD):
-----------------------
During the detailed phase, the view of the application developed during the high level design is broken down into modules and programs. 
Logic design is done for every program and then documented as program specifications. For every program, a unit test plan is created.
It defines the actual logic for each and every component of the system. Class diagrams with all the methods and relation between classes comes under LLD.

The entry criteria for this will be the HLD document. And the exit criteria will the program specification and unit test plan (LLD).

===============================================

HLDBased on SRS, software analysts will convert the requirements into a usable product.They will design an application, which will help the programmers 
in coding. In the design process, the product is to be broken into independent modules and then taking each module at a time and then further breaking them 
to arrive at micro levels. The HLD document will contain the following items at a macro level: 
	- list of modules and a brie description of each module 
	- brief functionality of each module 
	- interface relationship among modules 
	- dependencies between modules 
	- database tables identified along with key elements 
	- overall architecture diagrams along with technology details.
	
HLD contains details at macro level and so it cannot be given to programmers as a document for coding.
So the system analysts prepare a micro level design document, called LLD. This document describes each and every module in an elaborate manner, 
so that the programmer can directly code the program based on this.There will be at least 1 document for each module and there may be more for a module.
The LLD will contain: 
	- deailed functional logic of the module, in pseudo code 
	- database tables, with all elements, including their type and size 
	- all interface details with complete API references(both requests and responses) 
	- all dependency issues 
	-error message listings 
	- complete input and outputs for a module

High Level Design (HLD) gives the overall System Design in terms of Functional Architecture and Database design. 
It designs the over all architecture of the entire system from main module to all sub module. 
This is very useful for the developers to understand the flow of the system. 
In this phase design team, review team (testers) and customers plays a major role. 
For this the entry criteria are the requirement document that is SRS. And the exit criteria will be HLD, projects standards, 
the functional design documents, and the database design document. Further, High level deign gives the overview of the development of product. 
In other words how the program is going to be divided into functions, modules, subdivision etc.

Low Level Design (LLD): During the detailed phase, the view of the application developed during the high level design is broken down into modules and programs. 
Logic design is done for every program and then documented as program specifications. For every program, a unit test plan is created. 
The entry criteria for this will be the HLD document. And the exit criteria will the program specification and unit test plan (LLD).

The Low Level Design Document gives the design of the actual program code which is designed based on the High Level Design Document. 
It defines Internal logic of corresponding submodule designers are preparing and mapping individual LLD's to Every module. 
A good Low Level Design Document developed will make the program very easy to be developed by developers because if proper analysis is made and 
the Low Level Design Document is prepared then the code can be developed by developers directly from Low Level Design Document with minimal effort of 
debugging and testing. 

High Level Design (HLD) is the overall system design - covering the system architecture and database design. 
It describes the relation between various modules and functions of thesystem. data flow, flow charts and data structures are covered under HLD.
Low Level Design (LLD) is like detailing the HLD. It defines the actual logic for each andevery component of the system. 
Class diagrams with all the methods and relation between classes comes under LLD. Programs specs are covered under LLD.
