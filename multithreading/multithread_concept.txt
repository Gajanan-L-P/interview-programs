Multithreading in C-:
=====================
What is a Thread? 
  A thread is a single sequence stream within in a process. Because threads have some of the 
  properties of processes, they are sometimes called lightweight processes.

What are the differences between process and thread?
  Threads are not independent of one other like processes as a result threads shares with other 
  threads their code section, data section and OS resources like open files and signals. 
  But, like process, a thread has its own program counter (PC), a register set, and a stack space.

Why Multithreading?
  Threads are popular way to improve application through parallelism. 
  For example, in a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads. 
  MS word uses multiple threads, one thread to format the text, other thread to process inputs, etc.

Threads operate faster than processes due to following reasons:
  1. Thread creation is much faster.
  2. Context switching between threads is much faster.
  3. Threads can be terminated easily
  4. Communication between threads is faster.

Can we write multithreading programs in C?
  Unlike Java, multithreading is not supported by the language standard. 
  POSIX Threads (or Pthreads) is a POSIX standard for threads. 
  Implementation of pthread is available with gcc compiler.
